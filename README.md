### Link: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231786/rankingList
### The Challenge
- Training data : Search texts (queries) and their corresponding product images. 
 + Note that the host of the challenge has run some objective detections on the raw images. Then they extract embedding vectors and bounding boxes for each object in the image. So, we have in hand with a list of vectors, rather than normal images. They mentioned it's due to the copy right issues.
 + The data is from an E-Commrce website, with 3M rows in txt format (~ 124 GB).
- Requirements: Match the search text (query) and product image, i.e., for each query, pick top 5 most relevant images to the query => Learning Texts and Images => **Cross-modal retrieval** problem
